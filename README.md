# Swagger ExpressJS Scaffold

![](https://nodesecurity.io/orgs/niallmccullagh/projects/fa45839d-f7a1-4cab-aeed-c12b17dac2e3/badge)

This is an API scaffold which provides a design first approach to API development built on 
Swagger and ExpressJS.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Node environment](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#readme)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- Setup node dependencies from the api folder:
```bash
yarn install
```

## Editing the API Contract
See [Editing the API](docs/editing_the_api.md)

## Running

From the api directory of the project:

### Start the application (from this api folder):
```bash
yarn start
```

### Get API status
```bash
curl localhost:10010/v1/status
```

### Run specs
```bash
yarn test
```

### Run integration tests
```bash
yarn integration-test
```

### Linting the code
Runs static analysis on the code to identify problematic patterns or code that doesnâ€™t adhere to 
certain style guidelines.

Linting is there to guide you. If you feel yourself questioning rules then step back and think for 
a moment. These rules where created by people with extensive node experience so rather than 
suppressing the rule understand its purpose.

```bash
yarn lint
```

### Run vulnerabilities check
Use [nsp](nodesecurity.io) to run a vulnerabilities check on the projects dependencies.

```bash
yarn nsp
```


### With Docker
You can alternatively run it all in docker by following these [instructions](docs/running_in_docker.md)
